# Coding Problems

## Objective

This assignment aims to demonstrate how to study a data structures or algorithms question in depth to prepare for an industry coding interview. Leetcode is a popular coding practice site that many use to practice for technical interviews. Like behavioral interviews, it's important to practice and keep your skills sharp.

## Group Size

Please complete this individually.

## Outline

### Part 1:

You will be assigned one of three problems based of your first name. Excute "(hash('your first name')%3)+1" in python, and that will tell you your assigned problem. Include this line of code in your submitted notebook pdf. You can find the problem description in q[assigned number].md. They are based-off problems from Leetcode. 

### Part 2:

In a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, create 6 headings are write down the following:

-   Paraphrase the problem in your own words

-   In the .md file containing your problem, there are examples that illustrate how the code should work. Create 2 new examples that demonstrate you understand the problem.

-   Code the solution to your assigned problem in Python (code chunk). Try to find the best time and space complexity solution!

-   Explain why your solution works

-   Explain the problem’s and space complexity

-   Explain the thinking to an alternative solution (no coding required, but a classmate reading this should be able to code it up based off your text)

Alternatively, you may use a Quarto file, or Word document with code screenshotted. However, we highly recommended you learn how to use a Jupyter Notebooks.

Export each .ipynb file as a pdf. There are online converters, you can use the print option, or Google Collab has a printing feature. Please ensure all code and text is visible.

## Submission Requirements

Create and submit a public GitHub repository with the following:

-   The PDF of the problem you have solved

##Evaluation Criteria

-   Problem is accurately stated in the student’s own words

-   Two examples are correct and easily understandable

-   Correctness, time, and space complexity of the coding solution

-   Clarity in explaining why the solution works, its time and space complexity

-   Clarity in the proposal to the alternative solution

# Question Three: Missing Number in Range
 
You are given a list containing `n` integers in the range `[0, n]`. Return a list of numbes that are missing from the range `[0, n]` of the array. If there is no missing number, return -1. Note, all the integers in the list may not be unique.
 
## Examples

### Example 1

Input: `lst = [0, 2]`

Output: [1]

### Example 2

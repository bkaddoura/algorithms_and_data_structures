        "The code review experience was insightful. I was able to witness firsthand the process that other software developers use when breaking down a problem and understanding all its components. I have always been mystified by how these developers are able to write and review code so effortlessly, and now I see that it is a skill that can be developed through practice. In retrospect, I appreciate the value of code reviews and what another set of eyes can bring to a problem that is looked at through a single lens. Problems can be approached and solved in many ways, some more efficient than others. To speed up code deployment and communicate effectively with peers, code needs to be written simply, with clarifying variable and function names, and well-commented code."
